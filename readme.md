# gcsimba

## what is gcsimba

gc sim but a** (for now!)

## features supported
currently, the only explicitly implemented features are as follows:
- hu tao normal attacks
- hu tao skills
They don't have the correct frame counts either.

however, infrastructure has been implemented to make adding additional features relatively straightforward.
in particular, we implement an observer model which is quite flexible.

## how to run
can run an example script via
```
python main.py
```

no additional packages are required to run this, just base python 3.11.
